# hello-world

I'm a computer scientist by education.

I'm a user researcher and user centered designer by experience.

I'm a startup guy, and thus wearer of many hats.

But most especially, I design and develop and deliver great user experiences and user interfaces, of software or web or mobile tech.

The users' experience is the point of any product or service.
