# hello-world

I'm a computer scientist by education.

I'm a multiply-successful startup guy, and thus a wearer of many hats.

I'm a user researcher and user centered designer by interest and experience.

My passion is to understand people and what they are trying to do, and understand the latest tech and what it is capable of, and bring those understandings together to design and develop and deliver great user and customer experiences.
